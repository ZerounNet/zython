# Run this inside build/wasm/ to rebuild and run python-wasm. This is very
# useful if you want to modify the cpython source code to understand what
# is going on.  E.g., put printf's all over the place, type ./rebuild,
# and in a few seconds you are using python-wasm with those changes applied!
# **TODO** for some reason when make fails the build doesn't stop, so for
# now you MUST carefully watch the build for errors.
