List of the many, many little things that are broken or missing that specifically annoy me:

[ ] The parser doesn't let you use any of the string modifiers are variables, sort of.  In particular, for any letter in `vrufVRUF` (defined in `tokenizer.py`) in the repl we have:

```py
>>> f = 10
>>> f
1:0:Unterminated string constant
>>> print(f)
10
```

[x] Alternative to raw "v"-strings.  These are not valid Python, hence they break all Python tooling (e.g., syntax highlighting, formatting, running the module under real Python, etc.).  Instead, replace them by a function call with a normal string.   With v-strings you can't even load the code into normal Python since it gets stopped at the parsing stage.  It's much better if it is at runtime for normal Python, so you can run the same code with both jpython and normal Python.  Example, it would be nice to make something like this possible:

```py
def hello():
    try:
        v"console.log('hello world')"
    except:
        print('hello world')
```

The simplest solution would be this:

```py
def hello():
    try:
        javascript("console.log('hello world')")
    except:
        print('hello world')
```

There could even be a Python fallback to actually try to run the Javascript in some cases.

Another possibility could be to use Python raw strings with some special interpretation of those strings, e.g., `v"` --&gt; r`"something`

```py
r"js:console.log('hello world')"
```

I like using raw since it discourages using formatting characters in the string or thinking javascript(...) is a normal function call with a string  -- it isn't since the contents go straight to the output.

Another possibility would be a unicode character to make this even more obfuscated...

```py
r"œÅ:console.log('hello world')"
```

Nope that's horrible.  It could just be more verbose -- e.g., verbatim:  `r"verbatim:console.log"` 

Oh, I know, make it like an IPython magic:

```by
r"%js for(i=0;i<10;i++){console.log('blah')}"
```

[x] Implement + for lists -- which falls back to string concat right now :frowning:

```py
>>> [1,2,3] + [4,5,6]
[1, 2, 3][4, 5, 6]
```
