# WebAssembly version of Python built using Zig / Clang

## Motivation

- Pyodide [doesn't support using their build from node.js](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/issues/14), whereas we do support it here.

- Using zig/clang directly is much faster than using pyodide.


## Instructions

We'll have some when or if this works someday :shrug:...

```sh
