# Python Microbenchmarks

This is a collection of microbenchmarks of the core Python language. 
You can run any particular benchmark foo.py by typing:

```sh
$ your-python-interpreter src/foo.py
```

Many of these benchmarks are silly microbenchmarks that can be optimized
out with an optimizing compiler, but others are kind of interesting, like
the xgcd's with numbers.

You can run all of the benchmarks via

```sh
$ your-python-interpreter src/all.py
```
